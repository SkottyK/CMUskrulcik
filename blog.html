            <h2>Meerkat Saves Twitter</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="post_content">
            <p>Earlier today I read this <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/01/meerkat/">TechCrunch article</a> about how Meerkat, an up and coming video-sharing app that "one-ups Twitter" in real time content. Meerkat, though, is an entirely different medium than Twitter. Sure, its reliance on Twitter compells us to compare the two, but Meerkat's real competition is Snapchat. Specifically, Meerkat one-upped the Snapchat Story.</p>

            <p>Most of Snapchat's new features are not well recieved. Their text chat, video call, and mobile payment features all seemed to fizzle out after their initial release. Stories stand out as one of Snapchat's greatest successes, and have spawned spinoffs; Our Story and Discover are just professionally curated stories. Snapchat built its business on short-lived direct messages, but stories give snapchat a sense of permanance, and expand its social interactions beyond direct conversation. Wihtout stories, Snapchat would be better classified as a messaging app than a social network.</p>

            <p>The growth of Snapchat threatens Twitter because they share the 'now' space. In contrast with Facebook, which acts as a "timeline" of events and photographs in our life, Twitter and Snapchat are tapping a less permanent market. Their content is focused on what's happening now; when was the last time you looked at someone's two month old tweets? How often do you look at tweets that are more than 24 hours old? That explicit 24 hour cap on Snapchat stories may seem awfully strict, but the lifetime of a tweet isn't much longer. Meerkat takes stories a bit further. Of course their is a more private audience with a snap story than with a tweet, but the two are definitely in competition. If you're doing something really cool, and want your friends to see how cool you are right now, do you post a short Snapchat story or type out a tweet? Increasingly, snap story is winning that battle with teenagers. So how can Twitter fight back? Is Meerkat their answer?</p>

            <p>Meerkat is live. Cute twist, but not revolutionary. Meerkat is in your Twitter feed. Now that's interesting. Meerkat appears to be positioning themselves to be bought by Twitter, and that merger could work wonders. Right now, Meerkat's Twitter integration is scrappy, just ugly links embedded in a standard tweet. If Twitter were to take over, they could embed Meerkat streams into your feed. The decision to close the feed once the live video is over is interesting, but that is something that could be changed at a later date. In my opinion a little bit of permanance may help. Either way, once the feed is shut down, whether it closes after the live stream stops, or after a given period of time, a full Twitter integration would allow the feed to be hidden from your feed once it loses relevance.</p>

            <p>Twitter is already operating on a huge scale. It's still a leading source for up to the minute updates, and probably doesn't feel threatened by Snapchat. That said, they are losing some of their activity to Snapchat stories, and why let that happen? Twitter + Meerkat could be a killer combo. It would marginalize the value of Snapchat's story feature, because Twitter could offer the same, but embedded in an environment people already enjoy.</p>
